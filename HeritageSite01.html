                  Earlier is was a rock-shelter mountain monastery which was donated by Buddhist devotees. Later King Kassapa renovated it
                  by building gardens and palace. After his death it was again used as a monastery. Human habilitation in Sigiriya at its 
                  earliest was found to be nearly five thousand years during the Mesothilic period.<br>Rock inscriptions are carved near 
                  the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences.
                  These have been made within the period between the third century B.C and the first century A.D.</p>

                  The Sigiriya Rock is actually a hardened magma plug from an extinct volcano. The most significant feature of the rock would be
                  the Lion staircase leading to the palace garden. The Lion could be visualized as a huge figure towering against the granite
                  cliff. The opened mouth of the Lion leads to the staircase built of bricks and timber. However the only remains of this majestic
                  structure are the two paws and the masonry walls surrounding it. Nevertheless the cuts and groves in the rock face give an 
                  impression of a lion figure.</p>

                <p>
                  There are only two pockets of paintings covering most of the western face of the rock. The ladies depicted in the paintings have 
                  been identified as Apsaras. However a lot of these ladies have been wiped out when the palace was again converted into a monastery 
                  so as to not to disturb meditation.</p>

                  The gardens are amongst the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. The gardens are divided into three distinct but linked 
                  forms; water gardens, Cave and boulder gardens, and terraced gardens.</p>

                <p>
                  Originally this wall was so well polished that the king could see himself whilst he walked alongside it. Made of a kind of porcelain,
                  the wall is now partially covered with verses scribbled by visitors to the rock. Well preserved, the mirror wall has verses dating 
                  from the 8th century. People of all types wrote on the wall, on varying subjects such as love, irony, and experiences of all sorts.
                  Further writing on the mirror wall has now been banned.</p>
