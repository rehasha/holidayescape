        <p class="dambulla">
          Sri Lanka is rich and overflowing when it comes to colourful history, many came and went, the essence of the dominance 
          still lingers about in the cities and buildings. From Portuguese to Dutch, Sri Lanka has suffered and bloomed through
          many events.<br> Damulla is a large town situated in the Matale district, pretty near to Colombo. It is also given the
          title of a World Heritage Site. The town's most fascinated fact seems to be the time period of it's construction,
          it was built in just 167 days. Bursting with beautiful sites like the ironwood forest, rose quartz mountain, Rangiri
          Stadium and Na Uyana Aranya, one can't exactly pinpoint what this town is most known for.</p>

        <h3>History of Dambulla</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="AppImages/G3.jpg">
        <p>
            This historic temple dates way back to first century BCE. The structure can be explained as a overhanging rock looming over
            five enormous caves.When it was made, it was considered as one of the largest and most essential monasteries. The hands of many
            Kings and rulers have interfered with the temple, but it still stands and screams the history embedded deep inside every crack 
            of it's walls.
